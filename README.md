So, this project is Wikipedia-like.

**What's the idea:**

It is a website with a database of different authors and literature they have written. You can search, and if you are logged in you can add them to your favorites. You can delete, update, and create writers if you are an admin.

PS

When running for the first time in server/routes/main.js there is a function populate - you can run it, to populate your database.
And create in root folder .env file and add "MONGODB_URI=(connection string)" to use it
