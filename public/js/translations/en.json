    "body": "My name is Kira Yoshikage. I'm 33 years old. \nMy house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. \nI work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. \nI don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. \nAfter having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. \nJust like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. \nI was told there were no issues at my last check-up. \nI'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. \nI take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. \nThat is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. \nAlthough, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
